Ways to add Javascript in HTML
Inline Javascript: Within HTML tags, use the onclick (events-action) attribute or <script> tags.
Internal Javascript: Embedding JavaScript code within <script> tags in the HTML file's <head> or <body> section.
But it would be recommended to put JS at the end of the body tag.
External Javascript: Linking an external JavaScript file using the <script src="filename.js"></script> tag in the HTML file.

Variables 
Containers that store data related to our codes. And that data we can use or change wherever needed in our code.

Ways to Declare Variables in JavaScript
var: value can be reassigned, variables can be redeclared, and it has function scope.
let:  value can be reassigned, variables can’t be redeclared, and it has block scope.
const: value can’t be reassigned, variables can’t be redeclared, and it has block scope.

Rules for writing variables in JavaScript
1. Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). They can also include numbers (0-9), but cannot start with one.
2. You cannot use JavaScript-reserved keywords as variable names like var, let, const, function, if, else, return, etc.
3. It's a common convention in JavaScript to use camelCase for variable names.
4. JavaScript is case-sensitive, so myVar, MyVar, and myvar are all considered different variables.
